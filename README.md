-	Design and CFD analysis of axial turbine with 100 KW power output.

• Full-time researcher: Renewable Energy Lab - Kookmin University (2019)
-	Worked on satellite images to calculate cloud motion vector (CMV) using optical flow method and computer vision (Python/OpenCV) for solar irradiance forecasting.
-	Estimated every minute time series solar radiation data in South Korea using deep learning models such as RNN, LSTM, GRU, and CNN.
-	Successfully separated direct and diffuse irradiance from global horizontal irradiance by applying deep learning and transfer learning.
-	Conducted research on deep learning models to forecast cloud fractions for very short-term forecast horizons using a sky camera.
-	Solar irradiance, temperature, and humidity forecasting for energy saving of electric vehicles.
